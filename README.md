An Application that automates the process of making money online.
MPV2 (MoneyPrinter Version 2) is, as the name suggests, the second version of the MoneyPrinter project. It is a complete rewrite of the original project, with a focus on a wider range of features and a more modular architecture.

> **Note:** MPV2 needs Python 3.12 to function effectively.

## Yoku Tea Video Factory

Yoku Tea Video Factory is a safe MVP that reads a validated product card and a
content template, builds a deterministic Russian-language script, checks its
claims, and writes five files for manual review. Product cards live in
`data/products/`, templates in `data/templates/`, and isolated implementation
modules in `src/yoku/`.

The MVP does **not** generate video, images, voice-over, or recipes; call LLMs,
Ollama, external APIs, or websites; send messages; or publish content. Automatic
publication is disabled, and every generated draft must be manually reviewed.

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
python src/yoku_main.py generate --product taro-100g --template ozon-recipe
```

The command creates a directory such as
`output/20260724-120000_taro-100g_ozon-recipe/`, containing `brief.json`,
`script.txt`, `claims-report.json`, `metadata.json`, and `review.md`. Generated
packages are ignored by Git.

Run the checks with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m compileall src
```

Never store secrets or real API keys in Git. Keep local values in `.env`; only
the safe, empty `.env.example` template is versioned. A `PASS` from Claims Guard
does not authorize publication: the review checklist must still be completed by
a person, and `auto_publish` remains `false`.

## Scripts

For easier usage, there are some scripts in the `scripts` directory that can be used to directly access the core functionality of MPV2 without the need for user interaction.

All scripts need to be run from the root directory of the project, e.g. `bash scripts/upload_video.sh`.
